## üß™ STEP-BY-STEP TESTING PROCEDURE

### üî¨ PHASE 1: Local Testing (Same Computer)

**This tests if the basic functionality works:**

1. **Run server on your computer:**
   ```
   server.exe
   ```
   - Should show: "SERVER PASSWORD: XXXXXXXX"
   - Should show: "Server listening on port 9000..."

2. **Open another terminal and run client on SAME computer:**
   ```
   client.exe
   ```
   - Enter IP: `127.0.0.1`
   - Enter the password from server
   - Should show: "Starting to receive screen frames..."
   - Should create files: `remote_screen_000.bmp`, `remote_screen_001.bmp`, etc.

**Expected Result:** You should see BMP files being created with screenshots of your desktop.

### üåê PHASE 2: Network Testing (Different Computers)

**Only do this AFTER Phase 1 works successfully:**

1. **On Computer A (Host):**
   ```
   server.exe
   ```
   - Note the password displayed
   - Find Computer A's IP: `ipconfig` in command prompt
   - Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

2. **On Computer B (Client):**
   ```
   client.exe
   ```
   - Enter Computer A's IP address
   - Enter the password from Computer A
   - Should connect and receive screen frames

---

### üñ•Ô∏è PHASE 3: GUI Testing (Real-time Control)

**Use the new GUI viewer for live remote control:**

1. **On Computer A (Host):**
   ```
   server.exe
   ```

2. **On Computer B (Client):**
   ```
   viewer.exe
   ```
   - Enter Computer A's IP and password
   - Should open a window showing Computer A's desktop
   - Click and type to control Computer A

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING YOUR SPECIFIC ISSUE

### ‚ùå Problem: "Client terminal closes immediately"

**Possible Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Wrong Password:**
   ```
   Solution: Check password is EXACTLY correct (case-sensitive)
   Look for: "Authentication failed - wrong password" message
   ```

2. **Network Connection:**
   ```
   Solution: Test with 127.0.0.1 first (same computer)
   Check: Firewall settings on both computers
   ```

3. **IP Address Wrong:**
   ```
   Solution: Double-check IP address format
   Use: ipconfig to get correct IP
   ```

4. **Server Not Running:**
   ```
   Solution: Make sure server.exe is running and showing "waiting for connections"
   ```

## üìä DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS

### üîç Server Side Debugging

**What to look for in server.exe output:**

‚úÖ **Good Messages:**
```
SERVER PASSWORD: K8N2M7Q9
Server listening on port 9000...
=== NEW CLIENT CONNECTION ===
Received authentication attempt with password: 'K8N2M7Q9'
*** AUTHENTICATION SUCCESSFUL! ***
*** REMOTE CONTROL SESSION STARTED ***
```

‚ùå **Problem Messages:**
```
AUTHENTICATION FAILED - Wrong password!
ERROR: Failed to receive authentication data
ERROR: Failed to send initial screen info
```

### üîç Client Side Debugging

**What to look for in client.exe output:**

‚úÖ **Good Messages:**
```
Connecting to 192.168.1.100:9000...
Connected! Authenticating...
Authentication successful!
Starting to receive screen frames...
SUCCESS: Saved remote_screen_000.bmp
```

‚ùå **Problem Messages:**
```

## üéØ QUICK FIX CHECKLIST

### ‚úÖ Before Running:
- [ ] Both computers on same network (for LAN testing)
- [ ] Firewall allows port 9000 on host computer
- [ ] Server.exe is running and showing password
- [ ] Using correct IP address (run `ipconfig` on host)

### ‚úÖ During Connection:
- [ ] Password entered EXACTLY as shown (case-sensitive)
- [ ] IP address format correct (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
- [ ] No extra spaces in IP or password
- [ ] Server still running when client connects

### ‚úÖ For Network Issues:
- [ ] Try 127.0.0.1 first (same computer test)
- [ ] Windows Firewall ‚Üí Allow apps ‚Üí Add server.exe
- [ ] Router firewall settings (for internet use)
- [ ] Antivirus not blocking connections

## üéâ SUCCESS INDICATORS

### ‚úÖ You'll know it's working when:
1. **Server shows:** "*** REMOTE CONTROL SESSION STARTED ***"
2. **Client shows:** "SUCCESS: Saved remote_screen_XXX.bmp"
3. **BMP files created** with screenshots of host computer
4. **Server shows:** "Session active... (heartbeat X)" messages
5. **Test commands executed** on host computer

### üéÆ Control Test Results:
- Frame 5: Mouse should move on host screen
- Frame 10: Mouse click should occur on host
- Frame 15: Windows key should open Start menu on host

---

## üìû NEXT STEPS

1. **Try local test first** (127.0.0.1 on same computer)
2. **Check all error messages** carefully
3. **Use viewer.exe** for real-time GUI control
4. **Report specific error messages** if issues persist

The improved applications have much better debugging - you should now see exactly where the connection fails!
